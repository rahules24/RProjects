# üìàR Projects

This repository showcases personal data visualization and analysis projects using R, focused on exploratory insights, perceptual accuracy, and storytelling through plots.

## üìä Contents

- `finalProj_rahul.r`  
  The primary R script for the final project, analyzing 35 years of Tokyo weather data to explain why Japan aligns its seasons with temperature instead of daylight. Complements the full write-up in `document.pdf`.

- `plot1.R`, `plot2.R`  
  Supporting visual experiments, generating `plot1.pdf` and `plot2.pdf` respectively.

- `finalplot.pdf`, `LieFactor.pdf`  
  Final visualizations including bar plots and supporting analysis of graphical integrity (e.g., Lie Factor).

- `tokyo_data.xlsx`  
  Cleaned weather dataset used in the project, derived from a Kaggle source.

- `document.pdf`  
  The full written report detailing the background, method, observations, and conclusions of the final project.

- `lie-factor-curve.py`  
  A small Python script for verifying the Lie Factor calculation for one of the plots.

- `Lifespan-of-Cars_Infographic.jpg`  
  A challenge-based infographic redesign. The original misleading graphic was analyzed for data integrity flaws, then redrawn accurately using Digimizer. The corrected version emphasizes truthful, minimalist design. See accompanying report for explanation.

- `Lifespan-of-Cars_Infographic.dgz`  
  Digimizer project file containing original measurements and annotations.

## üìå Purpose

This repo documents a hands-on exploration of:
- Seasonality patterns in Japan
- R-based plotting with `ggplot2`
- Data cleaning and treatment
- Design decisions backed by perception and graphical integrity theory
- Graphical criticism and redesign (e.g., infographic challenge)

The final project serves as both a **technical demonstration** and **visual argument**, showing both conceptual and practical skills in data communication.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

- R (`ggplot2`, `readxl`)
- Python (`matplotlib`, `numpy` for lie-factor script)
- Excel (for data prep)
- Digimizer (for measurement-based graphical correction)
- Adobe Illustrator for cleaned visuals
